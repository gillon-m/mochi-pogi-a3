## Work flow
- Create feature on a feature branch
- Once feature is complete, create a pull request
- Pull requests must be reviewed by at least on other group member and pass travis-ci in order to be merged
- Merge branch to master
- All functional branches that pass these tests will be merge to the daily build (master) by the end of each day

## Creating Tests
Add test cases in the src/test/java folder
