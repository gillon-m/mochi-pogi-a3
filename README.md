## Work flow
- Create feature on a feature branch
- Once feature is complete, create a pull request
- Pull requests must pass travis-ci in order to be merged
- **SQUASH** and merge branch to master
- All functional branches that pass these tests will be merged to the daily build (master) by the END OF EACH DAY

## Development
- Add test cases in the src/test/java folder
- Add implementations in the src/main/java folder
